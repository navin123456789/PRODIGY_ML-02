Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering:

This project focuses on utilizing the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based ontheir purchase history.
Customer segmentation is a powerful technique that allows businesses to better understand their customer base, tailor marketing strategies,
and optimize customer experiences.In this project, we will be working with a dataset containing information about customers' purchase history.
The goal is to identify patterns and similarities among customers in terms of their purchasing behavior. K-means clustering, a popular 
unsupervised machine learning algorithm, will be employed to partition customers into distinct groups.


Clustering Analysis of Age and Spending Score:

In our exploration of customer segmentation using 'Age' and 'Spending Score (1-100)', we applied the Elbow Method to identify the optimal number of clusters. 
Two main clusters emerged with distinct characteristics.

Cluster 1 (Age 20-40, High Spending Score):
Customers within this age range demonstrate a high spending score, likely influenced by factors such as disposable income, lifestyle choices, and social trends.

Cluster 0 (Age 42-70, Medium Spending Score):
This cluster represents individuals with a more stable financial situation, displaying a balanced spending approach, and possibly having family responsibilities.

Variability in Spending Score (Age 20-70):
The observed variability in spending scores across different age groups can be attributed to diverse preferences, life stage considerations, and economic factors.


Conclusion:

The customer segmentation analysis yields valuable insights into distinct customer groups based on income, age, and spending behavior. These insights can be utilized
to shape targeted marketing strategies, enhance personalized customer experiences, and optimize product/service offerings.
